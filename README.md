# CVMouse2HandTrack

## All the basic functionality is described in another repository that supports tracking with only one hand. Here all gestures are identical to the past, so only the new functionality will be described here

To change the scale of an image, file, etc., you need to use this gesture. If we spread our hands, the image decreases, if we reduce it, it increases. To fix the image, you need to interrupt this gesture with any other, for example, show your palms
